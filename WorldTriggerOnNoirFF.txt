Chapter 1

Onoir multipartical excelerator (patent pending) worked. Only a tiny explosion had occurred which was pretty good for an unstable dimensional tear... prototype. It's now or never. Trigger on! Onoir leaps, diving through the portal. Pointing her destroyer back through the portal, she zaps the multipartical excelerator. It takes a second for it to stall. A couple of Rads fling themselves through using their pointy robotic legs. Onoir is able to smash them easily, since only those that arc through the center of the portal make it through "alive". 

The land near Onoir looks like ruins, chunks of concrete are lying in piles on the ground. On Onoir knew that miden was underdeveloped but this, this was more than she imagined. The clunk of dashing, trion warrior dashing, broke the silence. Quickly ducking into some rubble, Onoir hid.

"Hmm, looks we missed the battle." The girl!? leader stops near the portal entrance.
	"Aren't these Rads? Why would they be sending more, they know we just kill them." The girl fighter!? stabs a Rad with a trion sword.
"Anko, we got five rads for the support team." The leader looks towards border base, the high cubic building with a huge insignia spelling border. "No, I didn't kill them." She rolls her eyes and motions to continue scouting.

Onoir creeps towards the rads, making sure the girl warriors are gone. If only she had more time. Sighing she picks up the least damaged rad and takes it with her. Midan's not so unlike Aftokrator, just with more land, barren land, and woman fighters. Where they low on population? She could think about it later; now she haded away from the big hulking base that shouted come here so I can eat you.
